					What is HTML?
				</header>
				<p>
					HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the 
                    standard markup language for creating web 
                    pages. It defines the structure and content
                    of web pages, providing a means to organize
                    text, images, hyperlinks, and other 
                    elements into a coherent and interactive 
                    web document. HTML is the foundation of 
                    all web pages, forming the skeleton that 
                    browsers interpret and render into the visual 
                    content we see on the internet.
                    The building blocks of HTML are elements, 
                    which are represented by tags. Tags consist 
                    of a start tag (&lt;tagname&gt;), content, and an end tag
                    (&lt;/tagname&gt;). Elements define the meaning and 
                    structure of web page content, such as 
                    headings, paragraphs, images, and links.
                    Elements can have attributes, which provide 
                    additional information or modify the behavior 
                    of the element. Attributes are specified within
                     the start tag and consist of a name and a 
                     value, separated by an equal sign (e.g., 
                     &lt;/tagname attribute="value"&gt;).

				<p>
					Here's an example of a simple HTML code utilizing some of it's functionalities.<br>
				</p>
				<code>
					&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; 
					<br>
					&lt;html&gt;
					<br>
					&lt;head&gt;
							<br>
							&lt;title&gt;Hello World&lt;/title&gt;
							<br>
							&lt;/head&gt;
							<br>
                            &lt;body&gt;
                            <br>
                            &lt;h1>Hello World&lt;/h1&gt;
                            <br>
                            &lt;p&gt;Howdy!&lt;/p&gt;
                            <br>
                            &lt;img src="ManWaving.jpg" alt="Waving"&gt;
                            <br>
                            &lt;/body&gt;
                            <br>
                            &lt;/html&gt;

                        component of web applications, providing the 
                        basic structure and content that users interact 
                        with. Web applications like e-commerce platforms, 
                        social networking sites, and online banking 
                        systems rely on HTML to present their interactive 
                        interfaces.</li>
				</p>
				<p><li>Designing email templates: HTML is used to create 
                    email templates, ensuring consistent formatting and 
                    presentation across different email clients. These 
                    templates are widely used for marketing emails, 
                    newsletters, and transactional notifications.
                </li>
					<br>
					<li>Building interactive documents: HTML can be used 
                        to create interactive documents, such as online 
                        tutorials, presentations, and educational materials.
                         By combining HTML with JavaScript and other 
                         technologies, developers can create dynamic and 
                         engaging interactive experiences.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Prototyping and mockups: HTML is often used for 
                        quick prototyping and mockups of web pages and web 
                        applications. This allows designers and developers 
                        to visualize the layout and structure of the interface 
                        before diving into more complex development stages.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>These are just a few of the many applications of HTML. 
                        HTML is a versatile and powerful language that can be 
                        used to create a wide variety of web content.</li>

					CSS
				</header>
				<p>
					
                    Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used 
                    to style and layout web pages. It allows designers and 
                    developers to control the presentation of a web page, 
                    including the colors, fonts, sizes, and spacing of elements. 
                    CSS works in conjunction with HTML, which defines the 
                    structure and content of a web page, to create visually 
                    appealing and interactive web experiences.

                    <br>
                    <b>Key Features of CSS</b>
                    <br>
                    <li>Separation of concerns: CSS separates the presentation 
                        of a web page from its content, making it easier to 
                        maintain and modify the design without affecting the 
                        underlying HTML code.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Reusability: CSS styles can be defined and reused across 
                        multiple elements and pages on a website, promoting 
                        consistency and efficiency in code.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Cross-browser compatibility: CSS standards ensure that a 
                        website will look the same across different web browsers,
                         providing a consistent user experience.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Responsive design: CSS enables responsive web design, 
                        allowing a website to adapt its layout and appearance 
                        to different screen sizes and devices.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Accessibility: CSS can be used to improve the accessibility
                         of a website for users with disabilities, such as by 
                         adjusting font sizes, color contrast, and other visual 
                         elements.</li>

					JavaScript is a dynamic scripting language that enables web
                    developers to create interactive and engaging web pages. 
                    It empowers developers to add dynamic behavior to web pages
                    without requiring a full page reload, making it an essential 
                    tool for modern web development. JavaScript's versatility 
                    extends to a wide range of applications, from simple 
                    animations to complex web applications.

                    A key feature of JavaScript is its client-side execution, 
                    meaning the code is interpreted directly by the web browser, 
                    allowing for immediate responsiveness to user interactions. 
                    This event-driven paradigm enables JavaScript to respond to 
                    user actions like mouse clicks, keyboard input, and form submissions, 
                    triggering specific code blocks and updates.

                    JavaScript's ability to manipulate the Document Object Model
                    (DOM) grants developers control over the structure and content 
                    of web pages. By modifying the DOM, JavaScript can dynamically 
                    add or remove elements, change page layouts, and update content 
                    based on user interactions. This powerful feature enables the 
                    creation of rich and interactive web experiences.

                    JavaScript's asynchronous capabilities allow for non-blocking 
                    operations, meaning that network requests and other time-consuming
                    tasks can be performed without halting the execution of the main
                    thread. This asynchronous nature ensures that the user interface
                    remains responsive while background tasks are being processed.

                    It empowers developers to add dynamic behavior to web pages
                    without requiring a full page reload, making it an essential 
                    tool for modern web development. JavaScript's versatility 
                    extends to a wide range of applications, from simple 
                    animations to complex web applications.

                    A key feature of JavaScript is its client-side execution, 
                    meaning the code is interpreted directly by the web browser, 
                    allowing for immediate responsiveness to user interactions. 
                    This event-driven paradigm enables JavaScript to respond to 
                    user actions like mouse clicks, keyboard input, and form submissions, 
                    triggering specific code blocks and updates.

                    JavaScript's ability to manipulate the Document Object Model
                    (DOM) grants developers control over the structure and content 
                    of web pages. By modifying the DOM, JavaScript can dynamically 
                    add or remove elements, change page layouts, and update content 
                    based on user interactions. This powerful feature enables the 
                    creation of rich and interactive web experiences.

                    JavaScript's asynchronous capabilities allow for non-blocking 
                    operations, meaning that network requests and other time-consuming
                    tasks can be performed without halting the execution of the main
                    thread. This asynchronous nature ensures that the user interface
                    remains responsive while background tasks are being processed.

                    JavaScript's asynchronous capabilities allow for non-blocking 
                    operations, meaning that network requests and other time-consuming
                    tasks can be performed without halting the execution of the main
                    thread. This asynchronous nature ensures that the user interface
                    remains responsive while background tasks are being processed.
