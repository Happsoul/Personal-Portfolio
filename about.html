            My name is Sudesh Gurung, and I'm currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in computer science in hopes of achieving my goal of becoming a software engineer. Coming out of high school, I had a feeling of not knowing what I wanted to do with my life, so I felt college was going to be a waste of time since I had no direction for what I wanted to study and make a career out of. I decide to work, and after a while I realized that the field of computer science was something that I had interests in and knew I could make a solid career through. I had missed out on so many opportunities because I didn't have the knowledge to do what I wanted to do, and I'm very happy to be back in school chasing after my dreams. This is my 2nd year at MCCC, I have a 3.93 GPA, and I am planning on transferring to TCNJ for my 2024 school year.
